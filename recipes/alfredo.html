    <p><h4>This is my own personal alfredo recipe. For this sauce, I have never used
        an actual recipe. Everything is approximate (and from the heart), so please adjust to your taste.
    </h4></p>
    <h5><ul><strong>Ingredients!</strong></ul></h5>
        <li>1x 32oz. of Heavy Whipping Cream</li>
        <li>1 block of parmesan cheese. (I recommend freshly shredded parmesan
            for better flavor.)
        </li>
        <li>1 stick of salted butter</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to taste (If you don't want to see the pepper, use white pepper)</li>
        <li>Minced Garlic (Measure until your italian ancestors say stop)</li>
        <li>Italian Seasoning to taste</li>

    <h5><ol>Directions!</ol></h5>
        <li>Melt 1x stick of butter on low heat & add minced garlic -- Let cook for 3 minutes</li>
        <li>Slowly add in Heavy Whipping Cream (DO NOT over mix, could risk broken sauce)</li>
        <li>Once butter & cream are incorporated, slowly add in shredded parmesan, keep on low heat</li>
        <li>Keep adding cheese until melted and sauce is a creamy consistancy (or whatever consistancy you like)</li>
        <p>*NOTE* If butter and cream keep separating, that's okay. They will mix as more cheese is added.</p>
